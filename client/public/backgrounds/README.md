# Website Background

To change the website background:

1. Add your image to this folder (`client/public/backgrounds/`)
2. Name it `background.jpg` or `background.png`
3. Refresh the website to see your new background

**Supported formats:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`

**Recommended specs:**

The background will automatically have a semi-transparent overlay for better text readability.
